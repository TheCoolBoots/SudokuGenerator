# SudokuGenerator
A simple sudoku generator that I made for practice

Can consistently create up to a 16 by 16 sudoku solution, then hides a portion of them for
the player to find. It is possible to create a 25 by 25 solution, but due to the program's
O(n!) behavior, it will not do so in a timely manor.
